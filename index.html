    <p>People born today will never know what the world was like without Artificial Intelligence. The world is entering a new era of the internet, house cleaning robots, and cameras watching you wherever you go. Welcome to the 21st century! 
        This webpage will discuss the following aspects of Artificial Intelligence and it’s direct or indirect impact on the humankind. We will go over the history and how it grew to the juggernaut it now is.
        We will talk about how it has impacted the job industry and what people are doing to adapt to this sudden change. We’ll transition to how we, the human race, have been negatively impacted by AI and how we conform to it. 
        The beginning of AI all starts with psychologist Frank Rosenblatt in 1957. In that time, he developed what was called perceptron, a perceptron was a digital neural network that was designed to mimic a few brain neurons. Frank's first task for the network was to classify images into two categories. 
        He scanned images of men and women and he hypothesized that over time the network would learn the differences between men and women; or at least see the patterns that made men look like men and women
        The range of impact can be legal, political, societal, financial, and such a wide complex issue risk. The social implication is very manipulative in nature. It has a huge issue in target marketing which can swing your opinion. There’s also the issue of invasion, privacy, and spying
        The cost of AI is expensive. To own a smartphone is commonly around a thousand dollars. To own a nice working computer varies between 300 to two thousand dollars. Analytics predicts AI systems will cost us 58 billion dollars in the next few years. 
        Almost every job has partial automation potential, less than 5% are candidates for full automation today. If your job is predictable or somewhat routine, AI can do those tasks with ease. Corporate jobs want low risk but high-performance people to complete their tasks.
        If AI comes into the picture there will be no need to take dangerous jobs anymore!
        Artificial intelligence is an amazing fast advancing tool, but it also comes with ethical issues. One of the main ethical issues is using information to manipulate behavior. For example: gathered information on a person is collected online and off-line. This makes people vulnerable and can be easily manipulated using prior data. 
        They do this by collecting data and using algorithms to target the individual by the outcome of the patterns. The reason for the data collection is so that the online sellers, marketers, and advertisers gain the most money they can. There are many forms of manipulation! Another example is for political propaganda using social media. 
        Overall, the goal with that is influencing behavior of the voters and manipulating them to do what your advertisement says. 
        A conspiracy theorist would say this is brainwashing. Another example would be the unreliable evidence found online, pictures, audio, video, text, etc.
        Fake news has been a popular saying recently and because of all the vast amount of information at our fingertips,
        it is easy to be tricked and deceived by a manipulated answer. This is a problem because it makes it difficult to find overall reliable sources. The reason artificial intelligence is an overall ethical issue is because it interferes with individual privacy, protection and the overall civil liberties. Due to the fact that vast amounts of data are traded out to companies for the overall companies benefit. 
        Though there are regulations needed to follow for data protection some companies find ways around them. Creating the overall ethical issue of artificial intelligence invading privacy and personal information
