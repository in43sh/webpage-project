People born today will never know what the world was like without Artificial Intelligence. The world is entering a new era of the internet, house cleaning robots, and cameras watching you wherever you go. Welcome to the 21st century! 
This webpage will discuss the following aspects of Artificial Intelligence and it’s direct or indirect impact on the humankind. We will go over the history and how it grew to the juggernaut it now is.
We will talk about how it has impacted the job industry and what people are doing to adapt to this sudden change. We’ll transition to how we, the human race, have been negatively impacted by AI and how we conform to it. 
The range of impact can be legal, political, societal, financial, and such a wide complex issue risk. The social implication is very manipulative in nature. It has a huge issue in target marketing which can swing your opinion. There’s also the issue of invasion, privacy, and spying
The cost of AI is expensive. To own a smartphone is commonly around a thousand dollars. To own a nice working computer varies between 300 to two thousand dollars. Analytics predicts AI systems will cost us 58 billion dollars in the next few years. 
Almost every job has partial automation potential, less than 5% are candidates for full automation today. If your job is predictable or somewhat routine, AI can do those tasks with ease. Corporate jobs want low risk but high-performance people to complete their tasks.
If AI comes into the picture there will be no need to take dangerous jobs anymore!
