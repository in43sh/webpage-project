People born today will never know what the world was like without Artificial Intelligence. The world is entering a new era of the internet, house cleaning robots, and cameras watching you wherever you go. Welcome to the 21st century!

We will talk about how it has impacted the job industry and what people are doing to adapt to this sudden change. We’ll transition to how we, the human race, have been negatively impacted by AI and how we conform to it.  We talk about the philosophical meaning of AI and where it is about where AI is today as of 2020 and how we rely on it more than ever.
